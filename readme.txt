Nick Marchionda - API specification and startup for Project 3

Before starting:
	-Run startup.sql on your database, this sets up all the tables and relationships but doesn't insert any data
	-In appsettings.json, modify the DBInfo so it points to your database:
	"DBInfo": {
        	"Name": "{Your Database name}",
        	"ConnectionString": "User ID={Your username};Password={Your Password};
				     Host=localhost;Port={Your database port};Database={Your database name};Pooling=true;"
    	} 

All API endpoints are prepended with: {hostname}:{portnumber}/api
	ex: localhost:51423/api/Author
